# DIS-IBM-Power-Hybrid-Cloud
Hello! I'm David Spurway (IBM Power Systems CTO for UK and Ireland) and I am working on examples of Hybrid Cloud, including elements of AI. I shall be posting my progress here.

The plan is that I have learned a load in Phase 1, where I combined Node-RED and some Python scripts, which happen to be running in a Docker Container on an IBM Power System I have been given access to, with IBM Watson Assistant. What this is intended to do is help answer a question I and my colleagues get asked a lot, which is "When does this IBM Power System stop being sold/reach end of support?".

So, my first pass at this helps answer that question.

Later, I plan to build some demos, which I will show at the IBM Technical Univesity in Prague, combining AIX and IBM i into similar Hybrid Clouds, also using IBM Watson Assistant to put a Conversational Interface on the front of those systems.

Check here for how I get on!
